Task: Create a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence

Description:
Write a function that takes a number 'n' as input and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
- The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1.
- Each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

Example:
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(2) = 1
fib(3) = 2
fib(4) = 3
fib(5) = 5
...

Your function should work for inputs up to n = 40.

Bonus:
Implement the function using both recursive and iterative approaches.
Compare the performance of both implementations for large values of n.
